# Simulation for Belief Network Construction in IoT based on IoTNetSim
The simulation intends to use a Semantic-based Belief Network Construction Approach (SBNCA) to provide data fusion and fault detection in complex large-scale IoT systems.

Based on the IoTNetSim, we extended some classes such as SensorNode and GatewayNode to let the SBNCA get supported.

IoTNetSim is an open-source platform for modelling and simulation of end-to-end IoT services and networking. This repository is the online resources of the paper published in UCC 2019.
