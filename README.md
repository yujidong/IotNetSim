# Simulation for Belief Network Construction in IoT based on IoTNetSim
The simulation intends to use a Semantic-based Belief Network Construction Approach (SBNCA) to provide data fusion and fault detection in complex large-scale IoT systems.

Based on the IoTNetSim, we extended some classes such as SensorNode and GatewayNode to let the SBNCA get supported.
